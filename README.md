# hackney_telemetry

Telemetry adapter for Hackney metrics.

> [!NOTE]
> This version requires hackney 4.8. Hackney 4 no longer calls a `mod_metrics`
> module, so this library adds a [middleware](https://hackney.hexdocs.pm/middleware.html)
> that updates the request metrics and a poller that reads
> `hackney_pool:get_stats/1` for the pool metrics. For hackney 1.x use 0.2.0.

This module is a [metrics handler](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/blob/master/README.md#metrics)
for the [Hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney) HTTP client. It receives
calls from Hackney to update metrics and generates [Telemetry](https://github.com/beam-telemetry/telemetry) events.

Hackney supports storing metrics in [Folsom](https://hex.pm/packages/folsom) or
[Exometer](https://hex.pm/packages/exometer_core). Unfortunately, these
libraries do not export data in a way that is useful for Telemetry,
so we need to transform the metrics data before reporting it.

## Telemetry metrics

The following metrics are exported by this library to telemetry.

| Metric                      | Tags | Meaning                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `hackney.nb_requests`       | -    | Current number of requests                            |
| `hackney.finished_requests` | -    | Total number of finished requests                     |
| `hackney.total_requests`    | -    | Total number of requests                              |
| `hackney_pool.max`          | pool | Maximum number of idle sockets kept in a pool         |
| `hackney_pool.free_count`   | pool | Number of free sockets in a connection pool           |
| `hackney_pool.in_use_count` | pool | Number of busy sockets in a connection pool           |

Pool metrics are read every `report_interval` (every second when it's 0). In
hackney 4, `in_use_count` can go above `max`: `max` bounds the idle sockets,
not the busy ones.

Hackney 4 can't provide `hackney_pool.no_socket`, `hackney_pool.queue_count` or
`hackney_pool.take_rate`, so they are no longer reported.

The library also emits these events:

| Event                            | Metadata                                        | Meaning                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `[hackney, request, start]`      | method, host, pool                              | A request started                                     |
| `[hackney, request, stop]`       | method, host, pool, status, error               | A request returned, with its `duration`               |
| `[hackney, request, exception]`  | method, host, pool, kind, reason, stacktrace    | A request raised, with its `duration`                 |
| `[hackney, checkout_timeout]`    | host, pool                                      | A request got `{error, checkout_timeout}`             |
| `[hackney_pool, stats_timeout]`  | pool                                            | A pool didn't answer `get_stats/1` in time            |

`pool` is `none` for requests that don't use a pool. `status` is `undefined`
for errors and for async or streaming requests. Don't use `error`, `reason` or
`stacktrace` as tags.

To use it, make sure that the `hackney_telemetry` application starts before
your application.

The middleware and the pool poller call this module to update metrics, as
hackney 1.x did through `mod_metrics`. This module passes the data to a
`hackney_telemetry_worker` which keeps the current state of the metric and
generates Telemetry events.

Requests that set their own `middleware` option replace hackney's global chain,
so they are not counted.

A worker process has two jobs:

1.  Calculate metric values

    Hackney does not keep the state of its metrics, but instead emits events to
    the metrics engine, like "increase this counter by 1", "set this gauge to X",
    "add Y to this histogram". The job of a metric worker is to process these
    events and keep up-to-date state representing the value of the tracked metric.
    State updates run in constant time (O(1)), important since a single
    request generates about nine metric updates.

2.  Send metric values to Telemetry

    If we send the metric value to Telemetry after every update, then
    telemetry processing may not be able to keep up, and Telemetry will apply
    backpressure.

    Since the worker maintains the most up-to-date value, we can send the current
    value periodically. Gauge metrics may be less accurate, but it avoids overload.

## Installation

Install it from [Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/hackney_telemetry) or
[Github](https://github.com/msramos/hackney_telemetry).

## Configuration

No hackney configuration is needed: the application installs its middleware
when it starts.

### Options

#### Report interval

By default, workers will report data to telemetry every 1000 milliseconds.
If set to 0, events are generated after every update.

You can change that by setting the `report_interval` option:

**Erlang**

```erlang
{hackney_telemetry, [{report_interval, 2000}]}
```

**Elixir**

```elixir
config :hackney_telemetry, report_interval: 2_000
```

## Usage

After installing the module, your application will receive Telemetry events.
You can handle them in your application, or install a reporting module such
as [Telemetry.Metrics](https://hex.pm/packages/telemetry_metrics)
or [prom_ex](https://hex.pm/packages/prom_ex).

## Elixir

```elixir
defmodule YourApplcation.Telemetry do
  import Telemetry.Metrics

  def metrics do
  [
    # other metrics

    last_value("hackney.nb_requests"),
    last_value("hackney.finished_requests"),
    last_value("hackney.total_requests"),
    last_value("hackney_pool.max", tags: [:pool]),
    last_value("hackney_pool.free_count", tags: [:pool]),
    last_value("hackney_pool.in_use_count", tags: [:pool]),
    counter("hackney_pool.stats_timeout.count", tags: [:pool]),
    counter("hackney.checkout_timeout.count", tags: [:host, :pool]),
    distribution("hackney.request.stop.duration",
      unit: {:native, :millisecond},
      tags: [:host, :pool, :status]
    )
  ]
  end
end
```
